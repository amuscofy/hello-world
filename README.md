Learning to use github
Hello All
amuscofy here and new to github
I am currently learning Kotlin android development and
interested in using github to get my codes out there for Collaboration 
and comments from professional programmers here. I will also be using github to
seek help and learn new ways of getting things done easily during my kotlin android
development journey. I am excited to be here and i look forward to all i can get
done.
